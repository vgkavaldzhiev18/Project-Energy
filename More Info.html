		<h1><center><mark>What is Wind Power?</mark></center></h1>
		
		<br>
		<h3><center><mark>Wind power or wind energy describes the process by which the wind is used to generate mechanical power or electricity. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. This mechanical power can be used for specific tasks (such as grinding grain or pumping water), or can be converted into electricity by a generator.</mark></center></h6>

		<h1><center><mark>Wind Turbines</mark></center><h1>
		<br>
		<h3><center><mark>Wind turbines are most commonly found on large tracts of open land, called wind farms, or floating offshore. But, if you have enough real estate you can install a small wind turbine on your property to power your home. There are a few downsides to a wind turbine that make them less popular in residential areas. First, they’re not all that attractive and some can be pretty noisy. Plus, depending on where you live, local laws, HOAs, and zoning regulations may outright forbid wind turbines. But if these disadvantages don't apply to you, wind power can be a great asset. Wind power is more stable than solar, and a properly sized wind turbine can easily generate most or all of your electricity needs. And in some areas, wind might be a better renewable energy source than solar panels.</mark></center></h3>

		<h1><center><mark>Why Saving Energy is Important</mark></center></h1>
		
		<br>
		<h3><center><mark>Energy doesn’t come from anywhere. We’ve realized the benefit of emerging renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind energy. Even in light of these technologies, they don’t simply get made from anywhere.They require some form of industrial and electrical manufacturing. We will need to properly dispose and recycle these products at the end of their useful life. As a culture, we have become so consumed with products and electronics. We simply assume that electricity and energy resources will be with us forever. That is not true.</mark></center></h1>
